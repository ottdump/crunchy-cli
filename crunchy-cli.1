.SH UPDATE COMMAND
Checks if a newer version is available.
.TP

\fB-i, --install INSTALL\fR
If given, the command tries to update the executable with the newer version (if a newer is available).

.SH URL OPTIONS
If you want to download only specific episode of a series, you could either pass every single episode url to the downloader (which is fine for 1 - 3 episodes) or use filtering.
It works pretty simple, just put a specific pattern surrounded by square brackets at the end of the url from the anime you want to download. A season and / or episode as well as a range from where to where episodes should be downloaded can be specified.
Use the list below to get a better overview what is possible
    ...[E5] - Download the fifth episode.
    ...[S1] - Download the full first season.
    ...[-S2] - Download all seasons up to and including season 2.
    ...[S3E4-] - Download all episodes from and including season 3, episode 4.
    ...[S1E4-S3] - Download all episodes from and including season 1, episode 4, until and including season 3.

In practise, it would look like this: \fIhttps://www.crunchyroll.com/series/12345678/example[S1E5-S3E2]\fR.

The \fBS\fR, followed by the number indicates the season number, \fBE\fR, followed by the number indicates an episode number. It doesn't matter if \fBS\fR, \fBE\fR or both are missing. Theoretically \fB[-]\fR is a valid pattern too. Note that \fBS\fR must always stay before \fBE\fR when used.
